<p>We understand that deciding how your living or business space will look like and bringing it into 
reality is an exciting and sometimes a life changing journey.  Your project might be small, like
 turning a bathroom into a sanctuary or hallway into an office, while on the other side of the 
 spectrum, you are raising the roof (quite literally), extending the house or working on the strip
  out refurbishment of a hotel or a restaurant. <br>
   Every project is unique as are your requirements. 
  For that very reason our Design & Build services are split into stages so you can easily decide how
   much you’d like us to be involved. You can choose AD3 to work on your project’s design stage, build
    stage or both. </p>
    <p>For smaller projects with restricted funding you might need our assistance with design, 
    recommendation of trade professionals and bravely manage the project yourself or hire someone else to do it.
     For an even bigger saving you can use our Online Design Service. </p>
     <p> If, on the other hand, dealing with countless 
     trade professionals is the stuff of your nightmares and you just want to walk in once it is all over, 
     we’ll manage your project and put your mind at ease with the clear and structured project plan, regular
      reports and staged payments - a process that generates mutual trust and safeguards all parties involved. </p>

       <p>AD3 Design & Build collaborative offers design and build services under one umbrella, simplifying the
        process of choosing suitable professionals for your project.</p> 
        <p>Our fees are very competitive, their structure
         is simple and tailored to your project. Balancing yours, design and build teams’ requirements 
         and responsibilities, Project Manager is integral to our team and their fees are covered within 
         the build price once the building work commences. </p> 
         <p>If you have a project in mind and need help with
          it, get in touch - we’ll help you fall in love with it. We design and create exceptional and considered 
          spaces tailored to your desired lifestyle, financial abilities and your personal design flair.  
          We strive to integrate sustainable solutions wherever possible including both design and build stages. </p>

            Extensions: What You Should Know  Before Starting Your Project <br><br>
            
            You like where you live but the space is a bit tight and disorganised - very often 
             a  smart  alteration  of  an  existing  layout  could  be  the  right  answer.
              However,  in  some  cases  extending  up,  sideways  or  at  the  back  is  the 
               only solution to the problem. <br>
               The cost of an extension will mainly depend on: <br>
               -the quality of the build: standard, good, excellent-storeys & size<br>
                -your involvement  <br>
                -glazing amount If extending kitchen, add it to the list above.  <br>
                Excellent finish is on average 40% costlier than standard so carefully 
                balance the cost of your project with an estimated value it will add. With
                 our creative approach to both design and building stages we have found beautiful solutions for.

      <h4 class="qa__container--question">Can I make changes to my plans once they have been drafted? </h4>
      <p class="qa__container--answer">Not to blow our own trumpet but it is much easier to make changes when a single 
        company provides both design and building services. 
        Otherwise it really depends on your architect and your agreement on post alterations. </p>
      <h4 class="qa__container--question">What if you don’t have a speciﬁc trade specialist in your team? </h4>
      <p class="qa__container--answer">What if you don’t have a speciﬁc trade specialist in your team?</p>
      <h4 class="qa__container--question">How much control over the project do I have?  </h4>
      <p class="qa__container--answer">You have the control over project at all its stages: if working with AD3 project
         manager you will have a single point of contact for all the issues and regular reports of progress </p>
